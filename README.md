# One Page Javascript Projects

This repository was created on January 2020 to focus on my learning in Front-End design & development. The interactions in the games will be created mostly using vanila Javascript ES6 & CSS config, while the structures will be built using Bootstrap or HTML/CSS.

## Project Details
### Pig Game
**Created_on** 2020, 2 January
**Description**
The project was created as part of JavaScript Bootcamp by Jonas Schmedtmann.
**External credit** Panel design and HTML/CSS were provided from the course.
**What I did differently**
- All the Javascript codes were made from the scratch without following the given code.
- Rules are accessible from inside the game.
- Improvement in the design and microinteractions.
