# One Page Javascript Projects

This repository was created on January 2020 to focus on my learning in Front-End design & development. The interactions in the games will be created mostly using vanila Javascript ES6 & CSS config, while the structures will be built using Bootstrap or HTML/CSS.

### Pig Game
**Created_on** 2020, 2 January<br><br>
**Description**<br>
Pig game is a simple dice game that has few different version. In this one, two players are taking turn in rolling a die until a winner reach 100 points. In each turn, the active player can throw as many times s/he wants and decide when s/he wants to keep the score. If s/he roll a 1, s/he will loose all the points s/he has cummulated within that turn.
This project was created as part of JavaScript Bootcamp by Jonas Schmedtmann.<br><br>
**What I did differently**<br>
- All the Javascript codes were made from the scratch without following the given guided codes.
- Rules are accessible from inside the game. Rules tab is added into the page.
- Improvement in the design and microinteractions.<br>
**External credit** Panel design and HTML/CSS were provided from the course.<br>
